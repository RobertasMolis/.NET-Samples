We will be creating an application for shop

The shop will be similar to the warehouse project (BookStore);
It will include buy functionality;

The shop will be for ShopItem.
Prices will be Integers
The shop sells:
Name		Price(in Euros)		Quantity
Ice cream	2					4
Candy		1					4
Apple pie	3					4

We will have a single Buyer who has 10 euros.

We should have the following commands:

'Buy Ice cream 5' -> It should allow buying ice cream if Buyer has enough
money and enough stock. The last number will be quantity.
Buy command should update quantity.

'Show balance' -> display how much money the user have.

'List items' -> display items with updated quantities.

(Advanced)Non functional requirements:
We should have classes: ShopItem.cs, Shop.cs, optional -> Buyer.cs
